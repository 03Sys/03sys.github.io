        <p>He/Him, 22</p>
		<p>Greetings! I am Ziad A. You can call me that, along with Sys, or Mr. Megurine.</p>
        <p>In my beginnings of being an internet personality, it was in 2012 (two years after I got my first PC), when I was interested in a very specific thing called "Sparta Remixes", a really old trend that lasted for a long while (you might be familiar with YTMND and a remix of the "This is Sparta" scene from the movie 300). I was first known as ziadmario54321 and ziadSpartaX37. The aliases were based on other YouTube channel names (<a href="https://youtube.com/MarioMario54321">MarioMario54321</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com/KingSpartaX37">KingSpartaX37</a>). I used to make my videos and remixes very cheaply, but I kind of still gained interactions (and, obviously enough, a bit of hate). I had over 400 subscribers on my ziadSpartaX37 channel, until it got terminated because I changed its Google account birthdate. People missed my older media, and only a few of them were re-uploaded.</p>
        <p>I also was kind of known individual on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ziadmario54321">Scratch, the platform</a>. I created plenty of jokes and specific, ironic entertainment there, inspired by <a href="https://youtube.com/Podel">Podel</a>, and inside jokes that were very appreciative, from 2016 until 2018.</p>
        <p>In 2018 until 2020, on platforms like Twitter, I used to be interested in OS-tans, a term for moe gijinkas of operating systems, specifically the semi-official Windows OS-tans. I covered everything new and obscure, and I was a moderator of a subreddit dedicated to it, created by a mutual of mine.</p><br>
        <p>I am now merely a self-shipper, a beginner artist, an automated account creator, and an enthusiast of software & Vocaloid.</p>
        <p>My current fictional other is Luka Megurine, who I love very much. My active automated accounts are in its section.</p>

        <p>This is my personal website just as an index to my stuff.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, some of the code is AI-assisted. I edited it heavily anyway, as the main code wasn't entirely functional.</p>
