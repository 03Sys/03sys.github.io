<h1>Do Not Interact</h1>
<p>I want my space and accounts on various platforms to be safe spaces. So, do not interact if:<p>
<li>You're against any race, ethnicity, religion, ability, sexual orientation, and/or gender identity.</li>
<li>You don't care if someone (fictional or not) is a minor and you don't treat them like so. Basically, you sexualize them.</li>
<li>You have anything against self-shipping.</li>
<li>You self-ship yourself with Luka Megurine. I do not accept 'doubles' or 'sharing'.</li>
<li>You're not comfortable with how I post. Please check how I post before you decide to follow me.</li>
<li>I blocked you before on/from a different account.</li>
<li>You defend pe#ophilia and/or pro-shipping.</li>
<li>You support ships which involve Luka Megurine (or any other adult Vocaloid) with any of the Vocaloid minors. Out of here with your "they're robots" BS.</li>
<li>You are against K-POP stans. Listen, I used to be a K-POP individual. Also, they're less weird than you think.</li>
